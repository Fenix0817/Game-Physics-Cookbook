#Game Physics Cookbook

This is the code repository for [Game Physics Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/game-physics-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787123663), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#ifndef _H_MATH_VECTORS_
#define _H_MATH_VECTORS_
// Structure definitions
// Method declarations
#endif#ifndef _H_MATH_VECTORS_
#define _H_MATH_VECTORS_
// Structure definitions
// Method declarations
#endif
```

Working knowledge of the C++ language is required for this book, as the book is not a tutorial
about programming. Having a basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra will be
useful, but is not required. You will need a Windows PC (preferably with Windows 7 or higher)
with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 installed on it.
